note: this doesn't help much, b/c like gcc it doesn't actually support the vec report command (at least this one has the decency to *tell* you that when you try, though...)
you need to add 
#ifdef __INTEL_COMPILER
typedef __float128 _Float128;
#endif
before 
#include <math.h> 
if you want it to compile anything.
